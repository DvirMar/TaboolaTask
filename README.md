# TaboolaTask

******To run the task just open the index file using google chrome or drag the index file to a chrome icon******

Got a task to create Taboola widger using their api.

first I extracted the data and converted it to array of objects so i can work easier with the data
Then I took the data i needed from the objects and created the widger that contains 6 artices that changes dynamically.

Also added:
1. Showing the category of an article(if there is one) as a tooltip.
2. Limited the number of lines that the item title can take up to be three lines.
